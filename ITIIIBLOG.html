                <h1>LESSONS</h1>
                <h3>CHAPTER I: WHAT IS COMPUTING?</h3>
                <P>Computing is a broad field that encompasses the study of algorithms, hardware, software, and data. By studying computing, you can learn how to design, develop, and implement computer systems, as well as how to analyze and solve computational
                    problems.
                </P>
                <h3>CHAPTER II: PROFESSIONS & CAREERS IN COMPUTING</h3>
                <p>Professions and careers in computing encompass a wide range of roles, including software development, data analysis, cybersecurity, and system administration. With the constant evolution of technology, individuals in this field are often
                    involved in solving complex problems, innovating solutions, and contributing to the advancement of digital landscapes.</p>
                <h3>CHAPTER III: INFORMATION PROCESSING CYCLE</h3>
                <p>The information processing cycle is like a computer's recipe: it takes in data, works on it, stores it, and then produces a result.<br> It's the basic way computers handle information for tasks and applications.<br> </p>
                <h3> CHAPTER IV: INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SYSTEMS
                </h3>
                <p>An introduction to computer systems involves understanding the components that work together to process information.<br> This includes hardware like the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, as well as software that enables computers
                    to perform tasks and run programs.</p>
                <h3> CHAPTER V: BASIC CONCEPT OF COMPUTER SECURITY </h3>
                <p>Computer security involves protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. Fundamental concepts include authentication, encryption, firewalls, and regular updates to defend against evolving
                    threats and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.</p>
                <h3>CHAPTER VI: BASIC HTML & CSS</h3>
                <h1>THIS IS MY FAVOURITE LESSON</h1>
                <P>
                    I like HTML and CSS because they are the fundamental building blocks of the web. With HTML, I can create the structure and content of a web page, and with CSS, I can style and give life to that content. <br>Together, HTML and CSS allow
                    me to create websites that are both informative and visually appealing.<br> I find the process of creating websites to be both challenging and rewarding, and I am always learning new things about these two languages.</P>
